# Project Audit Report

Date: 2026-02-05  
Project: nextstat.io (NextStat plans)  
Auditor: Codex  
Scope: `docs/plans` (+ `docs/references`, `docs/legal`)  
Git Commit: unknown

## Executive Summary

- Critical: 0
- Major: 0
- Minor: 4
- Total: 4

Overall Health Score: 92/100  
Top risks: legal decisions (open-core boundaries + contribution policy) require counsel review; some code blocks remain explicitly "simplified" and may need clarification during implementation.

## Critical Issues

None found in this pass.

## Major Issues

None found in this pass.

## Minor Issues

### [Legal] Legal texts are drafts and need an explicit "decision point"
- File: docs/legal/open-core-boundaries.md:1
- Evidence: the document is marked as DRAFT and explicitly requires counsel review.
- Impact: without a deadline/owner for a "legal go/no-go", decisions can drift away from implementation (especially Pro/OSS split, DCO/CLA, trademark policy).
- Fix: add an explicit decision gate in Phase 0 (when counsel review is mandatory) and an owner; reference this gate in plans before accepting external contributions / first customers.
- Confidence: high

### [Docs] Some code/sections are explicitly marked as "simplified"
- File: docs/plans/phase-2c-gpu-backends.md:516
- Evidence: comments like "simplified version / actual impl ...".
- Impact: risk of treating a simplification as the final architecture and building the wrong thing.
- Fix: for each "simplified" block, add a short list: what is simplified + where the source-of-truth implementation lives (task id / file / section).
- Confidence: medium

### [Docs] Phase 0 contains intentional stubs/placeholders (ok, but must be bounded)
- File: docs/plans/phase-0-infrastructure.md:502
- Evidence: instructions expecting stubs (`import nextstat` "stub for now", CLI "not yet implemented", placeholder crates/bench).
- Impact: easy to forget to remove stubs and carry debt into later phases.
- Fix: for each stub/placeholder, add a checklist "remove stubs before exiting Phase 0/1" or explicit task ids in Phase 1.
- Confidence: medium

### [Planning] Phase 3/4 are described in the master plan without separate phase documents
- File: docs/plans/2026-02-05-nextstat-implementation-plan.md:2660
- Evidence: Phase 3/4 are listed as epics without task-by-task subplans, unlike Phase 0/1/2.
- Impact: when transitioning to Phase 3/4, teams will either improvise or rush to write plans -> schedule risk.
- Fix: when Phase 2 approaches completion, create `docs/plans/phase-3-production.md` and `docs/plans/phase-4-enterprise.md` (minimum: acceptance criteria + 4-6 epics + dependencies).
- Confidence: medium

---

## Feature Checklist

### Planning Docs (NextStat)
- [x] Single canonical math contract (`standards.md`)
- [x] Phases 2A/2B/2C clearly separated + linked
- [x] No Claude-specific executor notes
- [x] Reference docs exist and are linked
- [ ] Phase 3/4 have executable subplans (recommended)

---

## Unverified Areas

- Did not run builds/tests (at the time, the repository did not yet contain real Rust/Python implementation code).
- Did not validate HistFactory formulas/modifiers line-by-line against official specifications (plans only define the contract).
- Did not validate performance target realism on real models/datasets.

## Recommendations

1. Priority 1: lock the legal decision gate (DCO/CLA, repo split, trademark) before external contributions.
2. Priority 2: during implementation, track and close stubs with explicit tasks (not "later").
3. Priority 3: as Phase 3/4 approach, move them into separate phase documents (like Phase 2).
