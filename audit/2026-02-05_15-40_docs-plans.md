# Project Audit Report

Date: 2026-02-05  
Project: nextstat.io (NextStat plans)  
Auditor: Codex  
Scope: `docs/plans` (+ `docs/references`, `docs/legal`)  
Git Commit: unknown

## Executive Summary

- Critical: 0
- Major: 0
- Minor: 3
- Total: 3

Overall Health Score: 94/100  
Top risks: legal/compliance decisions require counsel review; some implementation sketches are marked as "simplified" and will need clarification during real implementation.

---

## Critical Issues

None found in this pass.

## Major Issues

None found in this pass.

## Minor Issues

### [Legal] An explicit "legal decision gate" is required before external contributors/customers
- File: docs/legal/open-core-boundaries.md:1
- Evidence: the document is marked DRAFT and requires counsel review.
- Impact: risk of drift between open-core boundaries and actual repository/release structure.
- Fix: add an explicit Phase 0 milestone "Legal reviewed" (owner + date) and make it a dependency for "accept external contributions / first customer pilot".
- Confidence: high

### [Docs] Phase 2C contains "simplified" implementation notes
- File: docs/plans/phase-2c-gpu-backends.md:516
- Evidence: comments stating that parts of the code are simplified.
- Impact: implementers may accidentally treat a sketch as the final architecture.
- Fix: for each "simplified" section, add a link to the concrete task id/section that describes the full implementation.
- Confidence: medium

### [Docs] Phase 0 contains intentional stubs/placeholders; do not forget to remove them
- File: docs/plans/phase-0-infrastructure.md:454
- Evidence: placeholder crates / stub Python package / "not yet implemented" for CLI.
- Impact: risk of carrying stubs beyond Phase 0/1.
- Fix: add an explicit "remove stubs" checklist in Phase 1 exit criteria or a dedicated "stub debt" backlog.
- Confidence: medium

## Feature Checklist

### Planning Docs (NextStat)
- [x] Single canonical math contract (`docs/plans/standards.md`)
- [x] Phases 2A/2B/2C clearly separated + linked
- [x] Phases 3/4 have dedicated subplans
- [x] Reference docs exist and are linked
- [x] No TODO/TBD placeholders left in plans

---

## Unverified Areas

- Did not run builds/tests (repo currently contains plans and reference docs; no implementation code at the time).
- Did not validate HistFactory numeric/physics details line-by-line against official specs (plans define contracts and test strategy).
- Did not validate performance targets on real models/datasets.

## Recommendations

1. Priority 1: lock the legal decision gate (open-core boundaries, DCO/CLA, repo layout, trademark).
2. Priority 2: during implementation, strictly close stubs/placeholders via a phase-exit checklist.
3. Priority 3: as real code lands, run a "plan-to-code fidelity" check (compile code blocks, smoke tests).
