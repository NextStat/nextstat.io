# Trademark Search Results — “NextStat” (Preliminary)

This document is a working draft and requires review by legal counsel. It is not legal advice.

**Search date:** 2026-02-06  
**Mark(s):** `NextStat`, `NEXTSTAT`, `Next Stat` (word marks; also checked close variants like `NEXSTAT`)  
**Jurisdictions:** United States (USPTO), European Union (EUIPO)  
**Intended goods/services (rough):** scientific/statistical software, CLI + Python package, analytics/inference tooling (likely Classes 9 and 42; possibly 35 depending on marketing/analytics positioning).

## 1) Summary (Knockout)

- **US (USPTO):** Found a prior mark **`NEXTSTAT`** tied to analytics software, but it appears **CANCELLED** (2014-12-12) per the accessible record. This is *good*, but does **not** guarantee availability (common-law rights, similar marks, and other conflicts may exist).
- **EU (EUIPO):** EUIPO search UI was not reliably accessible from this environment, so **EU results require a manual check** in eSearch plus (instructions below).

## 2) United States (USPTO) — Findings

### 2.1 `NEXTSTAT` — analytics software (CANCELLED)

Accessible reference (mirrors USPTO data):
- Source: Justia Trademarks — `NEXTSTAT` (Serial **78696902**, Reg **3424231**)
- Status shown: **CANCELLED — SECTION 8** (cancelled **2014-12-12**)
- Owner shown: **Webstat.com LLC**
- Goods/services shown (high-level): software for tracking website visitors; IC 9 / 35 / 42

Notes:
- Even if a federal registration is cancelled, **residual/common-law use** may still exist. Treat this as “not currently an active registration,” not as a clean clearance.
- Because this is highly similar to `NextStat` in spelling and pronunciation, it’s a key record to verify directly in USPTO/TSDR (manual verification steps below).

### 2.2 `NEXSTAT` — unrelated field (ACTIVE, potential confusion risk depends on scope)

Accessible reference:
- Source: Justia Trademarks — `NEXSTAT` (Serial **85725105**, Reg **4352112**)
- Status shown: **Registered** (Class 005; hemostatic powder / medical)

Notes:
- Different class/industry, but **name similarity** might still be relevant depending on channels and expansion plans.

## 3) European Union (EUIPO) — Manual Check Required

The EUIPO eSearch plus interface is heavily web-app-driven and was not reliably queryable from this environment. Please do a manual check:

1. Open EUIPO eSearch: `https://euipo.europa.eu/eSearch/`
2. Search terms to try:
   - `NextStat`
   - `NEXTSTAT`
   - `"Next Stat"` (quoted, if supported)
   - `NexStat`, `NEXSTAT`
3. Filter/inspect:
   - Status: filed/registered/opposed/cancelled/expired
   - Type: word mark vs figurative
   - Goods/services: focus on Classes 9 and 42 (and any others relevant)
   - Similarity: visually/phonetically similar marks (e.g., `NEXSTAT`, `NEXTSTAT*`)
4. Capture:
   - Application/registration numbers
   - Owners
   - Status + key dates
   - Nice classes + goods/services

If you find candidates, add them below under “EU findings” with links.

### 3.1 EU findings (to be filled after manual check)

- (none recorded yet)

## 4) Practical Recommendations (Non-legal)

- If `NextStat` is a long-term brand, do a **professional clearance search** (US + EU + key geos) before investing heavily.
- Consider reserving close variants/domains and ensuring consistent spelling (word mark vs stylized).
- If there is any meaningful overlap with the cancelled `NEXTSTAT` analytics mark, be prepared to document differentiation (product scope, target users, branding).
