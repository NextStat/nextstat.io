# TRExFitter-style config (subset) to verify ReadFrom=HIST masking semantics.
#
# This is a thin wrapper over a committed HistFactory export directory under
# `tests/baselines/trex/tttt-prod/histfactory_stage`.
#
# Intended assertions:
# - Region blocks act as channel include-lists (filter-only).
# - Sample blocks act as per-channel sample include-lists.
#
# NOTE: This is not a full TREx config; it is only the subset that NextStat's
# importer currently supports.

ReadFrom: HIST
HistoPath: tests/baselines/trex/tttt-prod/histfactory_stage

# Keep only SR_AllBDT and only (tttt, ttW) samples in that channel.
