# Don't set `target-cpu` globally: it breaks cross builds (e.g. wasm32) with a warning spam like
# "'apple-m4' is not a recognized processor for this target".
#
# Keep build artifacts out of the repo tree to avoid creating ~1M files under `target/`
# (bad for IDEs, FS watchers, and GitHub UX). You can always override this per-session:
# `CARGO_TARGET_DIR=/some/fast/disk cargo build`.
